Python GAE Session for Django 1.4
=================================

My attempt to make a `SessionMiddleware` for
Django 1.4 running on Google App Engine's Python2.7
runtime. It uses both GAE Datastore and Memcache.

GAE provides django-1.4 since the GAE python2.7
runtime released, so you can directly import it.
